# Clearing Cookies User Guide

## Here is how you clear cookies. 

1. Click settings in upper right corner of any browser. Usually the symbol is 3 dots and is usually next to a profile picture. 
2. Click settings in the pop-up menu. 
3. Look for clearing browser history or clearing cookies and cache. Depending on the browser it might be on the first page of the settings or you may have to search for it.
4. Once you have the pop-up window to select what items to clear, make sure to only clear cookies and cache, and set the time range to all time. This provides a clean slate to reload your web pages. 

Note:
This will log you out of any web applications. Make sure to save your work before clearing, and check that you know the passwords to log back into your accounts.
