# Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio. This site contains writing samples that demonstrate my approach to creating clear, user-focused documentation.

## About Me

### Kili Taylor

I am transitioning into technical writing after more than five years working in help desk and technical support roles. In those roles, I regularly documented procedures, resolved user issues, and translated technical information into clear, practical guidance.

This portfolio includes writing samples across several documentation types, including API walkthroughs, how-to guides, and troubleshooting articles. These samples reflect my learning process, my attention to clarity, and my focus on helping users complete tasks successfully.
