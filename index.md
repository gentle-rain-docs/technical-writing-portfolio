## About Me

### Kili Taylor

I’m a beginner technical writer with over 5 years of experience as a help desk technician. I write clear, user-focused documentation that helps people get productive quickly. This site contains samples of my work organized by type: API docs, how‑to guides, troubleshooting articles, and UX writing.
