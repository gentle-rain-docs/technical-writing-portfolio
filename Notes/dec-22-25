# Finally got the theme to activate after like 7 tries

Deploying a blog is more difficult then I anticipated. I know adding in the custom theme is the reason it's taking so long, but I want it to look nice. And the challenge is good for my brain.
Well that did not work like I wanted. Got to stop clicking on all the prompts github gives me. I accidently merged my drafts branch and deleted it. I will have to make a new drafts branch or find a way to restore it.
