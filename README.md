# Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository contains my technical writing portfolio, including API documentation, user guides, and process documentation.

This is my first time using Git, GitHub, and text editors. I expect to make mistakes, but I’m committed to learning and building a strong portfolio to showcase my work.

I am currently a help desk technician exploring opportunities in technical writing.
